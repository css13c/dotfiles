These are my configuration files for Vim, Git, and AHK.

To setup, simply do the following: 
	1. Clone git repository to location of choice.
	2. Open cmd with admin permissions
	3. Go to the location of dotfiles and run setup.bat.

This will only work on Windows machines. 

Note: Do not run the batch file by clicking on it, as running it as admin that way sets the current directory to System32. Not sure why.
